description: "Currently working on a node infrastructure to provide RPC with [Altitude](https://www.valtitude.xyz/), I wanted to be able to allow developers to send their transactions privately without going through the public mempool. I therefore added a method to the `eth` rpc  namespace of the reth client to meet this request."
