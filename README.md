# Querty's Personal Website

Welcome to the repo of my personal website! This is where you'll find all my cool projects and, someday maybe, fascinating articles (when I'm motivated enough to write).

Confession time: I used Astro and a template for this site. Why? Because I'd rather spend my time coding smart contracts than wrestling with CSS for hours. Frontend and I have a love story... one-sided love, that is. So, if you find any errors, feel free to open an issue.
