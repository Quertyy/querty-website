# Querty's Personal Website

Welcome to the repo of my personal website! This is where you'll find all my cool projects and, someday maybe, fascinating articles (when I'm motivated enough to write, don't hold your breath).

Confession time: I used Astro and a template for this site. Why? Because I'd rather spend my time coding smart contracts than wrestling with CSS for hours. Frontend and I have a love story... one-sided love, that is. So, if you find any errors, feel free to open an issue. And if you want to tell me how awesome my site is, my ego will be forever grateful.
